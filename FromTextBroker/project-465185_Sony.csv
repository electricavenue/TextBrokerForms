With a focal length that ranges 11-18mm, this lens helps to take perfect wide angle shots. To produce the perfect photo, its glass components are made from ashperical and extra low dispersion parts. The aspherical components help to reduce spherical deviations, while the extra low dispersion glass keeps your photos clear and with the convergence of color intact. The extra low dispersion glass comes into effect especially when you are zoomed in close.

The quality of the photos remain at a high level throughout all the settings in its 1.6x zoom capacity. This particular lens is for Alpha and Minolta digital cameras. When you need to zoom in and out, the size of the lens will not change. Externally, it is a unnoticeable process. Simply put, this wide angle lens produces images that are as close to what you see in real life as possible.

The SAL2875 encompasses a broad assortment of focal lengths ranging in angles from wide to medium telephoto lenses designed for superb dilineation while maintaining a fixed aperture and focal ratio of 2.8 throughout the entire range. 

The SAL2875 lens consists of 16 elements divided into 14 groups. Four aspherical lens elements, three low dispersion elements, and 2 X-ray spectroscopy elements help deliver sharp, clear photos throughout the zoom range across many energy level spectrums. The minimum focusing distance of the SAL2875 is 16 inches, letting one snap clear, focused, concise shots up close, as well as a front-end filter diameter of 67mm to aid photography in environments with high amounts of radio frequency interferance. The SAL2875 weighs in at a relatively light 20 ounces, enabling photographers to shoot to their heart’s content.

<strong>7x Circular Aperture Blade Diaphragm</strong>
The diaphragm of rounded aperture blades produce smooth, circular backgrounds when capturing direct sources in your pictures. Background sources have a pleasing defocused effect in dimmed lighting, effectively displaying an effective depth of field.

<strong>Fixed Filter Diameter: 67mm</strong>
	The 67mm front filter thread is stationary, allowing use of rotating polarizing filters.

<strong>Zoom Lock Switch</strong>
	The zoom lock switch allows to ensure your zoom stays right where you want it, preventing “lens creep”.

<strong>Smooth Autofocus Motor (SAM)</strong>
The Smooth AF Motor (SAM) has a rapid start and stop response that sends signals from the AF controls to the camera body using a micro-motor instead of the traditional AF drive-screw, resulting in quick and accurate AF response.

<strong>Minimum Aperture Range: f/32</strong>
The minimum f/32 aperture range helps you capture images in poor conditions by maximizing shutter speeds with lower ISO sensitivity.

<strong>Effective Focal Length</strong>
The focal lengths of 28-75mm and 42-112.5mm ensure high convergence and divergence from the front and rear principal plans, providing excellent angles of view.
